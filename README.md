# Inventory Manager Api
.Net Core Api along with React to create an Inventory Manager for shoes/sneakers

It uses React for the front end. I have some of my own custom hooks(useSearchParams or usePopUps). All stylings are tailwind CSS. 
The database is a MS SQL hosted on my computer. I ended up going with Dapper for my database mapper as oppsoed to EF core

I have demoed how adding a new product to the database would look like. I still use this web app that is locally hosted on my computer to this day.
