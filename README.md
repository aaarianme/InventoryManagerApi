# Inventory Manager Api
.Net Core Api along with React to create an Inventory Manager for shoes/sneakers

I created this app mainly for myself. When I started reselling shoes I quickly realized keeping track of all my inventory was not easy so that's why I created this.
It uses React for the front end. I have some of my own custom hooks such as useSearchParams or usePopUps. All stylings are tailwind CSS. 
The database is a MS SQL hosted on my computer. I ended up going with Dapper for my database mapper as oppsoed to EF core
